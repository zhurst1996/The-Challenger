    <p>I primarily work as a Front End Software Engineer and love working with <strong>javascript</strong> logic.</p>
    <p>These are currently the languages, frameworks, libraries, and other technologies I know and how long I've professionally worked with them.</p>

        This website is a mixture of my personal work and I've done to show and improve my skills as a software engineer as well to expand my knowledge in the vast world of technology. Feel free to click around, I hope that you find some of the work interesting!
